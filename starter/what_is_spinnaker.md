# What is Spinnaker?

The goals of this project is to create a Continuous Delivery platform that would:

* enable repeatable automated deployments captured as flexible pipelines and configurable pipeline stages
* provide a global view across all the environments that an application passes through in its deployment pipeline
* offer programmatic configuration and execution via a consistent and reliable API
* be easy to configure, maintain, and extend  
* be operationally resilient
